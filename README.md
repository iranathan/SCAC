# Spotify Content Availability Checker
SCAC allows anyone to find the markets where Spotify songs can be streamed ðŸŽ§

**Why?** Originally designed for the awesome [Rock Stars of the Spotify Commuity Rock Star Program](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Rock-Stars/ct-p/superuserarea), SCAC helps you to find out why any given track can't be played on Spotify.

## Get started
Using SCAC is easy. In fact, it's as easy as 1-2-3:
1. Head to [scac.itspugle.ga](https://scac.itspugle.ga) and click **Search**,
2. Authenticate the tool by pressing **Okay** on the Spotify authorisation page,
3. Paste in the Spotify URL or URI of a track and click **Search**!
