# Spotify Content Availability Checker
SCAC allows anyone to find the markets where Spotify songs can be streamed :headphones:  

**Why?** Because knowing about music licensing can be hard to stay "in the loop" about; and that's what SCAC is for. When music is truely available to all, it takes its trueform of inspiration.

## Get started
Using SCAC is as easy as one-two-three:
1. Head to https://scac.itspugle.ga and click "Search",
2. Authenticate the tool by pressing "OKAY" on the Spotify authorisation page,
3. Paste in the Spotify URL or URI of a track and click "Search"!
