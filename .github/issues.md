# Issues
Creating issues is the easiest way to contribute to SCAC, and it helps make the maintainers aware that people are actively using SCAC. Every issue helps to make SCAC the best piece of technology it can ever be. 

## How to create an issue
GitHub makes issues a breeze! To get started, simply:
  - Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join),
  - Head over to [this page](https://github.com/ItsPugle/scac/issues/new/choose),
  - Choose the right template (or use your own),
  - Fill in the issue and click `Submit new issue`
  
## What happens next
Once you've made an issue, all the maintainers will be emailed by GitHub. We'll then have a look at it, apply some labels to help us organise and get cracking on it! :smile:
